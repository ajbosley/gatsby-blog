Do I value my personal time less than my work time, or is it just more fun to learn new things, new ways and at least attempt to keep up to date with the ever increasing pace of JavaScript and web development practices?</p>\n<p>To answer this question I looked at the outcomes I want my backend to deliver.</p>\n<h2>Requirements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>REST API - <em>Could easily, and probably will in the future, add a GraphQL layer.</em></li>\n<li>Automated testing</li>\n<li>Authentication</li>\n<li>Authorization</li>\n<li>Connects to a database</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That’s a very generic and rather rudimentary set of requirements right? But it gives a good start and besides, every app should be test-able!</p>\n<p>I’ve almost exclusively worked with JavaScript since graduating university and love the language along with its incredible community of dedicated developers, so I chose <strong>NodeJS</strong> to write the server, <strong>ExpressJS</strong> to handle my API endpoints and routing, <strong>MongoDB</strong> as my database and <strong>Mocha w Chai</strong> as my testing framework.</p>\n<p><strong>NodeJS</strong> is a very well supported platform with an incredible number of open source packages, everything from indenting your code to machine learning libraries. This incredible eco-system leaves you with a wealth of packages to choose from that can do pretty much anything, certainly an overwhelming quantity for any newbie. I chose to stick with <strong>v8.13.^</strong> at the time of writing due to package support.</p>\n<h3>Is it important to choose a long term support (LTS) version?</h3>\n<p>Support for <strong>NodeJS</strong> is similar to that of Linux, a distribution or release version is chosen, and scheduled, for <em>long term support</em> and it therefore receives <em>long term support</em> for packages included with the release version and larger packages tend to stick with this support cycle. I say tend to as some packages aren’t as well maintained as others. Keep in mind that a lot of packages are maintained by the community, people like you and I, just more generous!</p>\n<h3>Now that I’ve chosen NodeJS, why did I choose ExpressJS over, say, Koa?</h3>\n<p>Choosing <strong>Koa</strong> may have been a smart choice if I was interested in following the state of JavaScripts surveys. They plug the average wage for <strong>Koa</strong> developers as XYZ% higher than <strong>ExpressJS</strong> devs, but life is not all about money. I could’ve spent my time learning <strong>Koa</strong> or I could work towards delivering the project and my knowledge of <strong>ExpressJS</strong> is greater.</p>\n<h3>We have a server technology, and a set of HTTP utilities, why MongoDB?</h3>\n<p>One of the biggest advantages I’ve found using <strong>MongoDB</strong> and <strong>MongoDB Atlas</strong> has got to be the incredible speed with which you can create schemas and adapt them to any use case, even halfway through development.</p>\n<p>I put a large value on this factor as I’m building a prototype, it’s likely to evolve during development. It’s also very likely to evolve once the first version releases production! It takes a while to stabilise a database schema when you’re one man. <em>Nobody is faultless.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Atlas</strong> also has a very good free tier that enables you to get up and running with a development and production database without any hassle.</p>\n<p>Creating schemas for a <em>“schemaless database”</em> seems odd, but it isn’t. It’s normal to want structure, that’s what a database is after all, a bunch of data points organised in a query-able and predictable manner.</p>"}
