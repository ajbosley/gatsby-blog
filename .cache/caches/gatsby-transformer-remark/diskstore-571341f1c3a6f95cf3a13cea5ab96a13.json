Do I value my personal time less than my work time, or is it just more fun to learn new things, new ways and at least attempt to keep up to date with the ever increasing pace of JavaScript and web development practices?</p>\n<p>To answer this question I looked at the outcomes I want my backend to deliver.</p>\n<h2>Requirements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>REST API - <em>Could easily, and probably will in the future, add a GraphQL layer.</em></li>\n<li>Automated testing</li>\n<li>Authentication</li>\n<li>Authorization</li>\n<li>Connects to a database</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That’s a very generic and rather rudimentary set of requirements right? But it gives a good start and besides, every app should be testable!</p>\n<p>I’ve almost exclusively worked with JavaScript since graduating university and love the language and it’s incredible community of speedy and dedicated developers, so of course I chose <strong>NodeJS</strong>, <strong>Express</strong>, <strong>MongoDB</strong> and <strong>Mocha w Chai</strong></p>"}
