Well, lets not spoil everything in one go!</h2>\n<p>The <strong>TrainingWall</strong> app covers, in its current form, one main use case. Creating routes on rock climbing training boards irrespective of board shape, size and design. If you can photograph it, you can create routes for it.</p>\n<p>A climbing center can have many boards, each board can have many routes. Routes are created by users, anonymous or registered.</p>\n<p>This design leads way for three different types of user:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Anonymous - <em>Under 16’s for GDPR compliance, no data stored on user</em></li>\n<li>Registered</li>\n<li>Center staff</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What’s the difference between authentication and authorization?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Authentication is proving you are who you say you are.</p>\n<p>Authorization is checking whether you have permission to perform an action, more importantly, it prevents you from performing actions you do not have permission to make.</p>\n<h2>TrainingWall Authentication</h2>\n<p>When looking at authentication, you’re immediately dealing with sensitive data, like it or not, it’s there so embrace it but most of all, secure it. Thankfully <strong>Atlas</strong> has built in, one click, encryption at REST.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Woo our data is secured at REST in the database but what are we going to do about passwords and in transit data?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In transit data is secured using HTTPS protocols as standard. We’ll get onto SSL certificates for the server later.</p>\n<p>Password management can present you with a world of hurt if your system is ever breached, and you notice, and the data is leaked. Encryption at REST is great but storing a plain text password in a database is tempting fate. No, no, no.</p>\n<p>My favourite encryption package has to be <strong>Bcrypt</strong></p>"}
