            I am an energetic and enthusiastic character and throw myself into
            projects with full commitment, I take pride in my ability to learn
            anything quickly, and have a natural lean towards mathematics and
            programming. That said, I am also a practical person. My skill and
            proficiency in climbing, sailing, surfing and windsurfing
            demonstrate this.

            Throughout my time at university I demonstrated my leadership skill
            and built upon this grounding at Lazy Susan. Most of all I am eager
            to work on projects where my abilities and characteristics will make
            a difference.
